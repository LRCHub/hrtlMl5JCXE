I feel the venom's burn
Upon this echelon
No hope remains

Open the golden gate
Only death and despair awaits
In the depths pulses an oozing infection

Beneath the tides dwell hidden lies
Serpents curling their backs
Envy-coated spines
Embracing their delusion
That the ship they're sailing

The wave of vipers weighing you down
You can swim or you can drown
Your gods are covetous leeches
Tear you to pieces in a sea of serpents
Their fangs are sinking into your back
Fade to black in a sea of serpents

Old venom in the veins of your idols
Surging like electric
No hope remains
Closer and closer
Closer and closer
I feel the venom's burn
Upon this echelon

Envy-coated spines
They embrace their delusion
Breeding a deaf generation
Where will I find my cure?

You can swim or you can drown
Your gods are covetous leeches
Tear you to pieces in a sea of serpents
Their fangs are digging in your back
Fade to black in a sea of serpents
Your gods are covetous leeches
They're golden demons in a sea of serpents

Amongst the lost and damned
Amongst the low and empty
With kings and queens I stand
Their power always tempting
Lay your vengeance
Let me become divine
You will feel my presence
In your envy-coated spine

The venom's burning
Turning idols to ash
Lost in the current
We were never made to last

We're all servants
Drowning in the sea of serpents
We're all servants
Drowning in the sea of serpents
We are servants
Drowning in the sea of serpents
We're all servants
Drowning in the sea of serpents
