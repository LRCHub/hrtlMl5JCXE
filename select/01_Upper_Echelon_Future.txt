Wave rock like Atlantic, froze like Atlantic
Party at the Sphinx, damn that's so outlandish (Straight up)

Walkin' through the Waldorf they know my name here
Dropped out, got signed, got mom house all in the same year
Don't you come around me, ain't got the time B na' (Straight up)

Knew how much I get, think La Flame the golden child
Ridin' right behind her, pull up beside her
We poppin' champagne, damn you apple cider

Pull out the seven, pull out the ride (Roll out)
We so high, upper echelon (Straight up)
We so fuckin' high, upper echelon damn!

Aight Travi' lets get it
Hustle Gang nigga! You niggas a mess, I swear you best show some respect
Or else I guarantee you'll get wet
You fuckin' with us, I suggest you invest in a vest
A choppa no less than a tech
You niggas want trouble in that I'm the best
They just wanna talk, I ain't finna do that
I just might pull up wherever you at
Put my foot in your ass and a hole in your hat
OK, hol' up, let me freeze up
These niggas must have caught amnesia
My face caught in these streets cuh
A1 credit, no Visa
Excuse me shawty don't get me started
If yo shit sick, my shit retarded
Motherfucker can't see the tree but before I
Get wrong get shot then leave 'em in the forest, gone
Wait til the end of the Earth
Just to get my check and bear get hurt
First thing first, this what I do
I'm a king motherfucker who the hell are you?
Jet suckas off top, I bet I do
Hustle gang in it bitch, you better lay down fool
We creme de la creme fuck them fuck niggas
Top shelf upper echelon can't fuck with us

Pull out the seven, pull out the ride (Roll out)
We so high, upper echelon (Straight up)
We so fuckin' high, upper echelon damn!

2 Chainz! Uh, pull up in the rari, my ho beside me
It's a two seater, your bitch can't ride, ho I'm sorry
Let's get it jumpin', call it center court
On the loud, you can smell that scent on me in court
Just beat the case, call it Larry Holmes
On the plane with your (Bitch in a carry on!)
I do it for my city, then I fly away
I can see tomorrow, I'm so high today
I told 'em let's pray, I keep killin' verses
Yo bitch with me, she wearin' killer purses
Pull out that seven, MAC eleven
Pastor, reverend, Versace heaven

Pull out the seven, pull out the ride (Roll out)
We so high, upper echelon (Straight up)
We so fuckin' high, upper echelon damn! (La Flame straight up)
