You know it's time for us to step it up
Another level now 'cause we finished warming up
So we rise up elevate to maintain fill up with
octane
And fan the flame we regain all the names
The enemy took away
And like a green beret we will lead the way
Into battle so have no fear we will draw near
So that we can persevere like a gondolier
We headed straight to the top nonstop
Set shop at the top of the Rock
You'll feel the aftershock after we rock the
spot
Cause you forgot these soldiers won't turn and
walk
We take hard knocks come back for more
Cause we're hardcore we fight for the One who
died for (you)
And like Saigon we're on the frontlines
And we carry on to the end times
[Chorus]
Now that it's on, we're out in the front of this
marathon
With our armor on, stay strong we drive on
(drive on)
Our echelon pressin' on 'til we reach the top
And you know we don't stop (our echelon)
Now that it's on
We're on the enemy's hit list
I'm hopin' you get this
You're takin' a risk when you resist the one who
made you exist
Evolutionists we got love for you too but we're
breakin' down
Walls seeking out the truth
I'm a soldier in this army of One
Like I told ya the battle's already won
So about face move outta the way I gotta pray
for you
And this is how we do
[Chorus]
